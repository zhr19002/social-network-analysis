### Network Modeling Application in Human Mobility Exploration Under A Disaster
> 'tract_POI_network.ipynb'
- Apply Python (Numpy, Pandas, and Networkx packages) to develop and analyze networks that connect census tracts and POI categories based on human mobility datasets (from SafeGraph Inc.)
- Apply Python (Matplotlib and Networkx packages) to visualize networks and highlight vulnerable parts in networks under a disaster
