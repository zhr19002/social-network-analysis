### Exploration of Human Mobility Under Disaster Through A Network Approach
#### Coding file: "tract_POI_network.ipynb"
- Develop networks that connect census tracts and POI categories based on Points-of-interest (POI) visit datasets (from SafeGraph Inc.) through Python Numpy, Pandas, and Networkx packages.
- Visualize networks and results through Python and identify vulnerable residents and significant POIs under a disaster based on network centrality measures.

### Role Identification in Collaborative Learning Through Social Network Analysis
#### Coding file: "collaborative_learning_network.ipynb"
- Collect and process data based on students’ messages on the discussion board in the “Principles of Construction” course.
- Develop and analyze social networks based on the processed dataset through ORA-LITE software (developed by CASOS at Carnegie Mellon)
- Visualize social networks through ORA-LITE, and identify students’ participatory roles (e.g., leader, animator, active, peripheral) based on network centrality measures.
